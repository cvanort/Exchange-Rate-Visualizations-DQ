# Exchange Rates (DQ Storytelling Visualization)

In this project, I visualize two aspects of exchange rates between 1999 and 2022: (1) the USD/Euro exchange rate during the 2007-2008 financial crisis; and (2) the USD/Euro exchange rate under the presidencies of Clinton (partial), Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden (partial).

This script was based on a Dataquest project: Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates.
